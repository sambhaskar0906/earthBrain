                                <h4>Cross Platform App Development Company in India</h4>
                                Earth Brain Technology is one of the best Cross platform app development companies, based in Gujarat. We develop cross platform applications for our clients so that we can reduce their expenses to some extent and provide them applications that can work across multiple platforms with no such issues.
                                <br>
                                There is a difference between a native app and a cross platform app. Native apps are built specifically for just one platform using languages like Kotlin, C++, Java, objective C or Swift. Such languages are used just for building applications for specific platforms like for Android apps, developers use Kotlin, C++ and Java. For building iOS apps, developers use objective C or Swift for the coding.
                                <br>
                                But for creating a cross platform app that can run seamlessly on any platform, developers work on languages like CSS, JavaScript and HTML for coding.<br>
